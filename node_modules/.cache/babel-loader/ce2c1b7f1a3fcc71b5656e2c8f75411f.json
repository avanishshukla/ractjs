Healthful eating also means replacing foods that contain trans fats, added salt, and sugar with more nutritious options. Following a healthful diet has many health benefits, including building strong bones, protecting the heart, preventing disease, and boosting mood. This article looks at the top 10 benefits of a healthful diet, and the evidence behind them. 1. Heart health Oscar Wong/Getty Images According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)Trusted Source, heart disease is the leading cause of death for adults in the United States. The American Heart Association (AHA) state that almost half of U.S. adults live with some form of cardiovascular disease. High blood pressure, or hypertension, is a growing concern in the U.S. The condition can lead to heart attack, heart failure, and stroke. Some sources report that it is possible to prevent up to 80% of premature heart disease and stroke diagnoses with lifestyle changes, such as increasing physical activity and healthful eating. The foods people eat can reduce their blood pressure and help keep their heart healthy. The dietary approaches to stop hypertension diet, known as the DASH dietTrusted Source, includes plenty of healthful foods for the heart. The program recommends the following: eating plenty of vegetables, fruits, and whole grains choosing fat-free or low fat dairy products, fish, poultry, beans, nuts, and vegetable oils limiting saturated and trans fat intake, such as fatty meats and full-fat dairy products limiting drinks and foods that contain added sugars restricting sodium intake to less than 2,300 milligrams per day \\u2014 ideally 1,500 mg daily\\u2014 and increasing consumption of potassium, magnesium, and calcium High fiber foods are also crucial for keeping the heart healthy. The AHA state that dietary fiber helps improve blood cholesterol and lowers the risk of heart disease, stroke, obesity, and type 2 diabetes. The medical community has long recognized the link between trans fats and heart-related illnesses, such as coronary heart disease. Limiting certain types of fats can also improve heart health. For instance, eliminating trans fats reduces the levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. This type of cholesterol causes plaque to collect within the arteries, increasing the risk of heart attack and stroke. Reducing blood pressure can also promote heart health. A person can achieve this by limiting their salt intake to no more than 1,500 milligrams per day. Food manufacturers add salt to many processed and fast foods, and a person who wishes to lower their blood pressure should avoid these products. Learn more about the DASH diet here. 2. Reduced cancer risk Eating foods that contain antioxidants can reduce a person\\u2019s risk of developing cancer by protecting cells from damage. The presence of free radicals in the body increases the risk of cancer, but antioxidants help remove them to lower the likelihood of this disease. Many phytochemicals found in fruits, vegetables, nuts, and legumes act as antioxidants, including beta-carotene, lycopene, and vitamins A, C, and E. According to the National Cancer Institute, though humans trials are inconclusive, there are laboratory and animal studies that link certain antioxidants to a reduced incidence of free radical damage due to cancer. Foods high in antioxidants include: berries such as blueberries and raspberries dark leafy greens pumpkin and carrots nuts and seeds Having obesity may increaseTrusted Source a person\\u2019s risk of developing cancer and result in poorer outcomes. Maintaining a moderate weight may reduce these risks. In a 2014 studyTrusted Source, researchers found that a diet rich in fruits reduced the risk of upper gastrointestinal tract cancers. They also found that a diet rich in vegetables, fruits, and fiber lowered the risk of colorectal cancer, while a diet rich in fiber reduces the risk of liver cancer.

In 2016, researchers found that diets with a high glycemic load may trigger increased symptoms of depression and fatigue. A diet with a high glycemic load includes many refined carbohydrates, such as those found in soft drinks, cakes, white bread, and biscuits. Vegetables, whole fruit, and whole grains have a lower glycemic load. If a person suspects they have symptoms of depression, talking to a doctor or mental health professional can help. 4. Improved gut health The colon is full of naturally occurring bacteria, which play important roles in metabolism and digestion. Certain strains of bacteria also produce vitamins K and B, which benefit the colon. These strains also help fight harmful bacteria and viruses. A diet low in fiber and high in sugar and fat alters the gut microbiome, increasing inflammation in the area. However, a diet rich in vegetables, fruits, legumes, and whole grains provides a combination of prebiotics and probiotics that help good bacteria thrive in the colon. These fermented foods are rich in probiotics: yogurt kimchi sauerkraut miso kefir Fiber is an easily accessible prebiotic and is abundant in legumes, grains, fruits, and vegetables. It also promotes regular bowel movements, which can help prevent bowel cancer and diverticulitis. 5. Improved memory A healthful diet may help maintain cognition and brain health. A 2015 study identified nutrients and foods that protect against cognitive decline and dementia. The researchers found the following to be beneficial: vitamin D, vitamin C, and vitamin E omega-3 fatty acids flavonoids and polyphenols fish Among other diets, the Mediterranean diet incorporates many of these nutrients. Read more about foods to boost brain function here. 6. Weight loss Maintaining a moderate weight can help reduce the risk of chronic health issues. Having overweight or obesity are risk factors for several conditions, including: heart disease type 2 diabetes poor bone density some cancers Many healthful foods, including vegetables, fruits, and beans, are lower in calories than most processed foods. A person can determine their calorie requirements using guidance from the Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2015\\u20132020Trusted Source. Maintaining a healthful diet free from processed foods can help a person stay within their daily limit without monitoring calorie intake. Dietary fiber is particularly important for managing weight. Plant-based foods contain plenty of dietary fiber, which helps regulate hunger by making people feel fuller for longer. In 2018, researchers found that a diet rich in fiber and lean proteins resulted in weight loss without the need for monitoring calorie intake. 7. Diabetes management A healthful diet can help a person with diabetes in: managing blood glucose levels keeping blood pressure and cholesterol within target ranges preventing or delaying complications of diabetes maintaining a moderate weight It is vital for people with diabetes to limit their intake of foods with added sugar and salt. They should also consider avoiding fried foods high in saturated and trans fats. Read about the best foods for diabetes here. 8. Strong bones and teeth A diet with adequate calcium and magnesium is important for strong bones and teeth. Keeping the bones healthy can minimize the risk of bone issues later in life, such as osteoporosis. The following foods are rich in calcium: low fat dairy products broccoli cauliflower cabbage canned fish with bones tofu legumes Food manufacturers often fortify cereals and plant-based milks with calcium. Magnesium is abundant in many foods, and some of the best sources include leafy green vegetables, nuts, seeds, and whole grains.\"\n          }, void 0, false, {\n            fileName: _jsxFileName,\n            lineNumber: 13,\n            columnNumber: 2\n          }, this)]\n        }, void 0, true, {\n          fileName: _jsxFileName,\n          lineNumber: 11,\n          columnNumber: 5\n        }, this)\n      }, void 0, false, {\n        fileName: _jsxFileName,\n        lineNumber: 10,\n        columnNumber: 5\n      }, this)\n    }, void 0, false, {\n      fileName: _jsxFileName,\n      lineNumber: 8,\n      columnNumber: 2\n    }, this)\n  }, void 0, false);\n};\n\n_c = AnnualReport;\nexport default AnnualReport;\n\nvar _c;\n\n$RefreshReg$(_c, \"AnnualReport\");","map":{"version":3,"sources":["/home/avanish/Desktop/my-app/src/pages/annual.js"],"names":["React","Row","Col","Container","AnnualReport","backgroundColor"],"mappings":";AAAA,OAAOA,KAAP,MAAkB,OAAlB;AACA,OAAOC,GAAP,MAAgB,qBAAhB;AACA,OAAOC,GAAP,MAAgB,qBAAhB;AACA,OAAOC,SAAP,MAAsB,2BAAtB;;;;AACA,MAAMC,YAAY,GAAG,MAAM;AAC3B,sBACC;AAAA,2BACA,QAAC,SAAD;AAAA,6BAEG,QAAC,GAAD;AAAA,+BACA,QAAC,GAAD;AAAO,UAAA,EAAE,EAAE,CAAX;AAAc,UAAA,EAAE,EAAE,EAAlB;AAAsB,UAAA,EAAE,EAAE,EAA1B;AAAA,kCACA;AAAM,YAAA,KAAK,EAAE;AAACC,cAAAA,eAAe,EAAE;AAAlB,aAAb;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,kBADA,eAEH;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,kBAFG;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AADA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAFH;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AADA,mBADD;AAuKC,CAxKD;;KAAMD,Y;AA0KN,eAAeA,YAAf","sourcesContent":["import React from 'react';\nimport Row from 'react-bootstrap/Row';\nimport Col from 'react-bootstrap/Col';\nimport Container from 'react-bootstrap/Container';\nconst AnnualReport = () => {\nreturn (\n\t<>\n\t<Container>\n    \n    <Row>\n    <Col   sm={4} lg={12} md={12}>\n    <h4   style={{backgroundColor: \"lightblue\"}}    >What are the benefits of eating healthy?</h4>\n\t<p>  A healthful diet typically includes nutrient-dense foods from all major food groups, including lean proteins, whole grains, healthful fats, and fruits and vegetables of many colors.\n\nHealthful eating also means replacing foods that contain trans fats, added salt, and sugar with more nutritious options.\n\nFollowing a healthful diet has many health benefits, including building strong bones, protecting the heart, preventing disease, and boosting mood.\n\nThis article looks at the top 10 benefits of a healthful diet, and the evidence behind them.\n1.
